### SDDP


## Usage

To use this library in you gradle project simply add the following repository definition to the project build.gradle:

```groovy
    maven {
        url 'https://maven.pkg.github.com/ag04/opta-api-soccer-model'
        credentials {
            username = System.getenv("GITHUB_PACKAGES_USERID") ?: "dmadunic"
            // Safe to share the password since it is a `read:package` scoped token.
            password = System.getenv("GITHUB_PACKAGES_IMPORT_TOKEN") ?: "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"
        }
    }
```
This package is published in github packages gradle repository, yet unfortunatelly due to the lack of public access to the published libraries this hack is needed.

Password is **readonly** personal access token (PAT) to github packages.
