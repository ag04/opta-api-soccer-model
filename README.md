# ag04/opta-api-soccer-model

AG04 Java representation of data model for OPTA soccer API (push and pull) 

## Usage

To use this library in you gradle project simply add the following repository definition to the project build.gradle:

```groovy
    maven {
        url 'https://maven.pkg.github.com/ag04/opta-api-soccer-model'
        credentials {
            username = "dmadunic"
            password = "cd1682474e79efb726afe2dd08f902b3da7aa993"
        }
    }
```
This package is published in github packages gradle repository, yet unfortunatelly due to the lack of public access to the published libraries this hack is needed.

Password is **readonly** personal access token (PAT) to github packages.
